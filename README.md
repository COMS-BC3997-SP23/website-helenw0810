## RENT THE RUNWAY - CAMPUS EDITION

Project: Mobile application to facilitate campus-wide clothing, apartment, object renting.

Strengths: 
Campus community as target users ensures constraints of user age range - almost guaranteed majority similarity in trend preferences and interests in similar activites. Same day rental - delivery is handled by proximity to campus whereas online nationwide rentals (rent the runway) requires processing and shipping time to be accounted for (our age range likes and will prefer faster access). Users (students) are encouraged to rent out their items to justify cost of purchasing ROI for an item they want. Users (students) are encourage to also search for the item they want on this platform if they are unsure about committing the financial cost of fully owning an item they like if they know they will not be using it everyday. 

Technical features of focus for implementation: 
Posting, instant messaging, student email OAuth to prevent bot/spam as seen on Columbia Buy/Sell facebook page, calendar/time reservation for pick up or drop off, commenting on posts, search function off keywords

Framework (planned):
React Native, Firebase (backend, pay by user so can worry about funding after development)

Plan of attack:
Develop for iOS first as more students have iOS than android. 

Timeline (optimistic prediction):
at 4-5 months/end of semester - have a locally presentable MVP with at least half the features mentioned above but not deployed on app store by any means
at 9 months/start of next fall - have a deployable app that can be reviewed by Apple to deploy on app store officially - will worry about funding for backend hosting here

Mentors/Outside resources for me to utilize:
Adil Virani - Co-Founder of Blitz.gg - will be able to give advice on technical questions, framework questions, division of focus for efficiency when choosing how/when to focus on development of features to best be able to meet my timeline

Christina Grammeros - Solo Founder of VOLVITA - will be able to give advice on pitching for funding and product presentation
