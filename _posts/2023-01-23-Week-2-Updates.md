# Mobile Application: Lockr

## Introduction
Lockr is a mobile application aimed at facilitating the rental of clothes among students. The application will be developed using React Native CLI, a popular framework for building native mobile apps using Typescript and React. This report outlines the initial setup and research process for the development of Lockr.

## Setup
To begin the development of the application, the following setup steps were undertaken:

1. **Environment Setup**: The development environment was configured to ensure compatibility with React Native CLI. This involved installing Node.js, the React Native CLI, and the required dependencies.

2. **Project Initialization**: A new React Native project was initialized using the React Native CLI. This created the necessary project structure and configuration files. I followed the information found on React-Native CLI setup website.

3. **Version Control**: A Git repository was initialized to enable version control for the project. This allows for collaboration and tracking of code changes throughout the development process.

4. **IDE Selection**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was chosen for the project. This decision was based on personal preferences and the availability of features that facilitate React Native development. My personal choice was Visual Studio Code.

## Research Process
To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the target audience, market landscape, and technical requirements, extensive research was conducted. The following steps were undertaken during the research process:

1. **Target Audience Analysis**: Detailed research was conducted to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience - students. Surveys, interviews, will be conducted to gather insights into their clothing preferences, rental habits, and pain points related to sharing clothes.

2. **Competitor Analysis**: A thorough analysis of existing clothing rental platforms will be performed. This involves studying their features, user experience, pricing models, and any unique selling points. By identifying strengths and weaknesses, we aimed to refine the concept and differentiate Lockr from competitors.

3. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**: The technical feasibility of implementing the desired features will be evaluated. This involves assessing the compatibility of React Native CLI with the required functionalities such as user authentication, photo uploads, messaging, and payment integration. Additionally, any potential challenges or limitations were identified to inform the development process.

4. **Wireframing and Prototyping**: Wireframes and prototypes will be created to visualize the user interface and user flow of the application. This iterative process involves gathering feedback from potential users to refine the design and ensure a seamless user experience.
