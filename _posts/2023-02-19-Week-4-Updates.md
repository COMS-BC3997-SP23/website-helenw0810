# Research Update: Student Interests and Desired Features

## Introduction
This report provides an update on the ongoing research conducted to gather insights into the interests and desired features of students for the application. The goal is to ensure that the application meets the expectations and preferences of the Barnard and Columbia target audience. 

## Methodology
To gather data and feedback, the following research methods were employed:

1. **User Interviews**: In-depth interviews were conducted with a select group of students to gain a deeper understanding of their clothing rental experiences and expectations. These interviews provided valuable qualitative data, allowing us to explore their motivations, concerns, and aspirations related to clothes sharing.

2. **Focus Groups**: Several focus group sessions were organized, bringing together small groups of students to discuss their thoughts, ideas, and suggestions for the application. These sessions provided an interactive platform for participants to share their perspectives, collaborate, and generate new feature ideas.

## Research Findings
Based on the data collected through interviews and focus groups, the following key findings have emerged:

1. **Convenience and Ease-of-Use**: Students expressed a strong desire for a user-friendly and intuitive interface that simplifies the process of renting clothes. They emphasized the importance of a streamlined and hassle-free experience, from browsing available items to making transactions.

2. **Trust and Safety**: Building trust among users is crucial for the success of the  application. Students highlighted the need for robust verification mechanisms, secure payment options, and user ratings/reviews to ensure a safe and reliable platform for clothes sharing.

3. **Search and Discovery**: Students expressed a keen interest in advanced search and filtering options to quickly find clothes that match their preferences. They also emphasized the importance of comprehensive item descriptions, high-quality images, and the ability to save favorite items for future reference. 

4. **Communication and Messaging**: Seamless communication between renters and borrowers is vital. Students desired an integrated messaging system within the application to facilitate communication, negotiation of rental terms, and coordination of pick-up/drop-off arrangements.

5. **Community Engagement**: Students expressed a desire to foster a sense of community within the platform. They suggested incorporating features such as user profiles, social sharing options, and the ability to follow and connect with other users who share similar fashion interests.

## Next Steps
Based on the research findings, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Feature Prioritization**: The identified features and insights will be analyzed and prioritized based on their feasibility, impact on user experience, and alignment with the overall goals of the application.

2. **Design Iteration**: The research findings will inform the iterative design process, ensuring that the user interface and experience address the desires and expectations of students.

3. **Development Planning**: Will review the research findings to plan and prioritize the implementation of the desired features. Technical feasibility and resource requirements will be considered during this phase.

4. **User Testing and Feedback**: As the development progresses, user testing sessions will be conducted to gather feedback and validate the implemented features. This iterative feedback loop will help refine and improve the application based on real-world user experiences.

## Conclusion
The research conducted to understand student interests and desired features for the ClothesShare application has provided valuable insights into their preferences and expectations. By incorporating these findings into the design and development process, we aim to create a user-centric platform that meets the needs of students seeking convenient, trustworthy, and engaging clothes sharing experiences. Moving forward, the prioritization of features, iterative design, and user testing will play crucial roles in refining and enhancing the application.
